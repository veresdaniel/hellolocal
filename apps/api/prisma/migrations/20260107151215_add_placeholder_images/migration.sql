-- Add default placeholder image settings
-- These are optional settings that can be configured in the admin panel
-- If not set, they will be null and the frontend will handle the fallback

-- Note: We don't insert default values here, as they should be set via the admin panel
-- This migration is just for documentation purposes and to ensure the keys can be used
